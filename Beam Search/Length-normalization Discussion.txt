Assignment 1: Beam SearchTask 3: Discuss the effect of length-normalization module.* Normalization is done to prevent probability to decrease rapidly to very low value.* By normalizing we give a fair chance for long sentences to compete with shorter sentences.* Larger the normalizing parameter the higher the chance of getting longer sentences.* In our test case we have taken normalizing parameter as 0.7 (which is less than 1) and that’s why we are getting smaller sentences in case of BeamsearchV2.* Normalizing parameter lower than 1 will result in shorter sentences in BeamSearchV2 than BeamSearchV1* Normalizing parameter greater than 1 will result in longer sentences in BeamSearchV2 than BeamSearchV1Conclusion: Length-normalization adjusts the score of the sentences with respect to the length of the sentence.
